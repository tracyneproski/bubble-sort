# Bubble Sort
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology.

**Parameters**

Array

**Returns**

Sorted Array

Problems
-
Create a method that takes an unsorted array and uses the bubble method, comparing successive pairs of array elements and shifting the larger number to the right, to return a properly sorted array.

What I used
-
Ruby arrays, loops

What I learned
-
Probably more math.
